# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```

Reciever Contract = 0xF3249CB20b9DF78709fFe365a88f7cB47e3365c3 (sepolia)
Sender Contract = 0x20C22eB7119A5C0e84443461f9887020b35DDE8F (avax fuji)
